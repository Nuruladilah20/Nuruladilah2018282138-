<p>Experience ?? Hmmmâ€¦.</p>

<p>Work experience? Yes I help my family a lot in managing the business and to some extent I can 
add knowledge about the field of business. I started entering this business world when I was 15 years
old, and I found out that I was very interested in this field.</p>

<p>After finishing school, I used to work in a shoe store to earn extra money on my own. I can add more 
knowledge in business.</p>

<p>In April 2018, I was selected to enter the National Service Training Program(PLKN)for 3 months. With 
this program, I started learning to be independent because I had never been separated from my family before. 
I was also taught about the spirit of love for the country. We were taught to do a variety of extreme activities. 
And we are also taught to march so that we can discipline ourselves.</P>

</p>After that, I got an offer at UiTM Merbok. I who am in Selangor feel very afraid to study far away because 
I know that I will be separated from my family. But because I want to fulfill the dream of a father who wants to 
see his daughter study at UiTM, so I went too even though it was too hard to leave the family. But when I started 
studying, I started to feel comfortable with the atmosphere of a new place. Lots of experiences I gained while studying. 
From here I learned how to live without a family, learned to choose the right friends, and I also learned to resist 
longing for family. But I am thankful because throughout my studies, I was accompanied by a cousin who also studied here. 
Despite being bullied often, I learned to live strong in people's places.</p>
